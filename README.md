# CryptoMart
I have developed a Decentralized application considered a Web3-enabled Application with login functionality through the Web3 login with Metamask and an interactive frontend. The Application must communicate with an underlying smart contract deployed on the Sepolia test network deployed in Elastic Beanstalk.
